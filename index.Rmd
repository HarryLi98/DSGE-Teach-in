# Introduction

**Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)**:
- *Dynamic* - Intertemporal problems and agents rationally form expectations
- *Stochastic* -  Allow for exogenous stochastic processes such as random shocks
- *General Equilibrium* - Agents are utility maximising and markets are in equilibrium

### Motivation
- Popular in macroeconomics research
- Explaining historical time-series data and for forecasting
- Widely used by Central Banks

### Aim
- Introduction to DSGE Modeling
- Derive simple DSGE models analytically

### Prerequisites
- Method of Lagrange multipliers useful but not essential

???
### Motivation
- DSGE models are widely used in macroeconomic research, for example to explain and predict co-movements of aggregate time series over the business cycle as well as to perform policy analysis. DSGE models are a prominent tool for forecasting at central banks, such as the Bank of England's COMPASS. Therefore, it's useful to understand how these models work.

### Aim
The aim of this teach-in is to give an introduction to DSGE modeling. At the end of this teach-in, you should be able to derive simple DSGE models analytically. Technical mathematical details are omitted, but useful resources are provided at the end for further reading. 

### Prerequisites
No prerequisites are required except some basic knowledge of convex optimisation, in particular the method of Lagrangian multipliers is useful.

# Overview
We focus on models with:
- Discrete time
- Infinite Horizon
- Representative households

.full-width[.content-box-blue[The *representative household* assumption means that all households' preferences are identical. That is, preferences can be represented as if a single household made the aggregate consumption and saving decisions subject to a single budget constraint.]]

???
The methods for continuous time problems are largely the same but the maths is slightly more complicated when working in continuous time.

The representative household assumption limits us to answering questions pertaining to the aggregate economy. Incorporating heterogeneity allows us to answer questions on distributional impacts. 

---
# Deterministic Consumption-Saving Problem

Individual household chooses paths for consumption and saving at time $t$ to maximize the discounted sum of utilities
$$\max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}} \sum_{\tau = t}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau - t} u(c_{\tau})$$
subject to the budget constraint for each $t$:
$$c_{t} + s_{t} \leq y_{t} + Rs_{t-1}$$
### Assumptions 
- $u'>0, u''<0, \lim_{c \to 0} u'(c) = \infty, \lim_{c \to \infty} u'(c) = 0$
- $s_{t} \geq 0$ 
- Constant interest rate $R$
- Exogenous deterministic income stream $\{y_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}$

We are interested in the equilibrium paths for $\left\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\right\}_{\tau=t}^{\infty}$.

???

This maximization problem can be solved in a number of ways, for example, by setting up an infinite-dimensional Lagrangian. But the most convenient and common way of approaching it is by solving recursively.

---

# 1. Identifying control and state variables

.full-width[.content-box-blue[**Control variables** are variables that agents choose.]]
Control variables are usually easy to identify. In this example, the control variables are $c_t, s_t$.

.full-width[.content-box-blue[**State variables** are:
- Predetermined - the agent can observe the values for the state variables at time $t$ prior to making a decision.
- Relevant - the value of state variables affect the agent's choices and utility.
- Not redundant - the information the state variable contains cannot be summarized in a simpler way.
]]

State variables are more difficult to identify. In this example, there is an endogenous state variable $s_{t-1}$ and an exogenous state variable $y_{t}$.

---

# 2. Set-up the Bellman Equation
Define $V(s_{t-1}, y_{t})$ as the value of the above maximisation given the endogenous state $s_{t-1}$ and exogenous state $y_{t}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
    V(s_{t-1}, y_{t}) &= \max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}} \sum_{\tau = t}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau-t} u(c_{\tau})  \\
    &= \max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}} \left\{u(c_{t}) + \beta\sum_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau - (t+1)} u(c_{\tau}) \right\} \\
    &= \max_{\{c_{t}, s_{t}\}} \left\{u(c_{t}) + \beta \max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty}} \left\{\sum_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau - (t+1)} u(c_{\tau}) \right\}\right\} \\
    &= \max_{\{c_{t}, s_{t}\}} \left\{u(c_{t}) + \beta V(s_{t}, y_{t+1}) \right\}
\end{align*}
$$
where the maximisation is subject to the same date $t$ budget constraint.

---
# 3. Solving the Bellman Equation

There are two ways to solve the recursive problem. Either
- Substitute the budget constraint into the Bellman equation to remove one choice variable. Then solve by taking first-order conditions.
- Set-up a Lagrangian to solve the constrained maximisation problem

Using Lagrangian:
$$\mathcal{L} := u(c_{t}) + \beta V(s_{t}, y_{t+1}) + \lambda_{t}[y_{t} + Rs_{t-1} - c_{t} - s_{t}]$$

Take first order conditions:
$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{t}}: \qquad & u'(c_{t}) - \lambda_{t} = 0 \label{eq:focc}\\
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial s_{t}}: \qquad & \beta \frac{\partial V_{t+1}}{\partial s_{t}} - \lambda_{t} = 0 \label{eq:focs}
\end{align}
$$
Notation: $V_{t} = V(s_{t-1}, y_{t})$.


---
# 4. Envelope Conditions

Without proof:
$$\frac{\partial V_{t}}{\partial s_{t-1}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial s_{t-1}}$$

When taking the derivative of the objective function with respect to the state variable $s_{t-1}$, the state variable can be treated as an **independent variable** that will not affect the endogenous choice variables.

In this example,
$$\frac{\partial V_{t}}{\partial s_{t-1}} = \lambda_{t}R$$

which can be iterated forward one period to get: 

$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:envelope}
\frac{\partial V_{t+1}}{\partial s_{t}} = \lambda_{t+1}R
\end{equation}$$

---
# 5. Collect terms
First, we can combine the envelope condition in equation \eqref{eq:envelope} with equation \eqref{eq:focs} to get

$$\beta R \lambda_{t+1} - \lambda_{t} = 0$$
Combining equation \eqref{eq:focc} with the above, we get the inter-temporal optimality condition for household consumption, otherwise known as the household Euler equation:

$$u'(c_{t}) = \beta R u'(c_{t+1})$$
---
# 6. Check
If you did everything correctly, you should have an equal number of equations as unknown variables.

The unknown variables in our example are the same as our control variables $c_{t}, s_{t-1}$.

The Household Euler equation, the budget constraint and the transversality condition:
$$
\begin{align}
  u'(c_{t}) = \beta R u'(c_{t+1}) \tag{E1} \\
  c_{t} + s_{t} = y_{t} + Rs_{t-1} \tag{E2} \\
  \lim_{T \to \infty} \beta^{T} u'(c_{T}) s_{T} = 0 \tag{TVC}
\end{align}
$$
characterise the equilibrium conditions that pin down $\left\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\right\}_{\tau=t}^{\infty}$.

Given a specific utility function and parameter values for $\beta$ and  $R$, the path for consumption and savings $\left\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\right\}_{\tau=t}^{\infty}$ can be estimated on a computer. There are many methods - the simplest (but also slowest) being Value Function Iteration.

# A more complicated example
Consider a competitive closed economy in which the representative household chooses the rule of consumption, labor and stock holdings ${c_t, n_t, a_t}$ in order to maximize the expected discounted utility:
$$\mathbb{E}_{t}\left\{\sum_{\tau=t}^{\infty}\beta^{\tau-t}\left[2(c_{\tau})^{\frac{1}{2}}-n_{\tau}\right]\right\}$$
subject to the budget constraint:
$$c_{t}+p_{t} a_{t}=w_{t} n_{t}+\left(d_{t}+p_{t}\right) a_{t-1}$$
where $w_{t}$ is real wage rate, $d_{t}$ is dividend and $p_{t}$ is ex-dividend price of the stock, and $\mathbb{E}_{t}\{\cdot\}$ is expected value of conditional on information at date $t$.

There is also a representative firm which maximizes the profit (=dividend) $d_{t} = y_{t} - w_{t} n_{t}$ subject to the production function,
$y_{t}=A_{t} n_{t}{ }^{\alpha}$ where $0<\alpha<1$

The aggregate productivity $A_{t}$ is either high at $A^{H}$ or low at $A^{L}$, and follows a Markov process as:

$$\mathbb{P}\left(A_{t+1}=A^{H} \mid A_{t}=A^{H}\right) = \mathbb{P}\left(A_{t+1}=A^{L} \mid A_{t}=A^{L}\right)=\gamma >\frac{1}{2}$$

The supply of shares is normalized to be one per households, and the market clearing condition is given by $a_{t} = 1$ and $y_{t} = c_{t}$.

- Derive the conditions of the competitive equilibrium of this economy.

---
# Competitive Equilibrium
.vmiddle[
A **competitive equilibrium** is an allocation $\left\{c_{\tau}, n_{\tau}, a_{\tau}, d_{\tau}, y_{\tau}\right\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}$ with prices $\left\{p_{\tau}, w_{\tau} \right\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}$ such that the allocation solves the household and firm's maximisation problem and the allocation is feasible.
]

---
# 1. Identify control and state variables

The control variables are: ${c_t, n_t, a_t}$.

The state variables are: $a_{t-1}, A_{t}$.

- In general, *prices* are **not** state variables, because they are not predetermined.

???
In general, *prices* are **not** state variables, because they are not predetermined, but rather determined in a rational expectations equilibrium. Households can calculate their optimal decision as a function of prices, and then prices are determined through market clearing conditions. While prices are not observable at time $t$, the assumption that households are rational means that they are able to form expectations on prices. Therefore, $p_{t}, w_{t}$ are not state variables.

---
# 2. Set-up the Bellman Equation

Define $V(a_{t-1}, A_{t})$ as the value of the above maximisation given the endogenous state $a_{t-1}$ and exogenous state $A_{t}$.

$$
\begin{align*}
    V(a_{t-1}, A_{t}) &= \max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\sum_{\tau = t}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau-t} u(c_{\tau}, n_{\tau})\right]  \\
    &= \max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}} \left\{u(c_{t}, n_{t}) + \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\sum_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau - (t+1)} u(c_{\tau}, n_{\tau})\right] \right\} \\
    \textit{(Tower rule)} &= \max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t}^{\infty}} \left\{u(c_{t}, n_{t}) + \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\mathbb{E}_{t+1}\left[\sum_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau - (t+1)} u(c_{\tau}, n_{\tau})\right]\right] \right\} \\
    &= \max_{\{c_{t}, s_{t}\}} \left\{u(c_{t}, n_{t}) + \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\max_{\{c_{\tau}, s_{\tau}\}_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty}} \mathbb{E}_{t+1}\left[\sum_{\tau = t+1}^{\infty} \beta^{\tau - (t+1)} u(c_{\tau}, n_{\tau})\right]\right] \right\} \\
    &= \max_{\{c_{t}, s_{t}\}} \left\{u(c_{t}, n_{t}) + \beta\mathbb{E}_{t}[V(a_{t}, A_{t+1})] \right\}
\end{align*}
$$
where the maximisation is subject to the same date $t$ budget constraint.

---
# 3. Solving the Bellman Equation
The Lagrangian for the representative household's maximisation problem is:

$$\mathcal{L} := 2(c_{t})^{\frac{1}{2}}-n_{t} + \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}[V(a_{t}, A_{t+1})] + \lambda_{t}[w_{t}n_{t} + (d_{t} + p_{t})a_{t-1} - c_{t} - p_{t}a_{t}]$$

Take first order conditions:

$$
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_{t}}: \qquad & (c_{t})^{-\frac{1}{2}} - \lambda_{t} = 0 \label{eq:focc2} \\
  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial n_{t}}: \qquad & -1 + \lambda_{t}w_{t} = 0 \label{eq:focn2} \\
  \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a_{t}}: \qquad & \beta \mathbb{E}_{t} \left[\frac{\partial V_{t+1}}{\partial a_{t}}\right] - \lambda_{t}p_{t} = 0 \label{eq:foca2} \\
\end{align}
$$
---
# 4. Envelope Conditions
$$\frac{\partial V_{t}}{\partial a_{t-1}} = \lambda_{t}(d_{t} + p_{t})$$

which can be iterated forward one period to get: 

$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:envelope2}
    \frac{\partial V_{t+1}}{\partial a_{t}} = \lambda_{t+1}(d_{t+1} + p_{t+1}) 
\end{equation}$$

---
# 5. Collect terms
First, we can combine the envelope condition in equation \eqref{eq:envelope2} with equation \eqref{eq:foca2} to get:
$$\beta \mathbb{E}_{t} [\lambda_{t+1}(d_{t+1} + p_{t+1})] - \lambda_{t}p_{t} = 0$$
Combining equation \eqref{eq:focc2} with the above, we get the household Euler equation:
$$\beta \mathbb{E}_{t} \left[\frac{d_{t+1} + p_{t+1}}{\sqrt{c_{t+1}}}\right] = \frac{p_{t}}{\sqrt{c_{t}}}$$

Combining equations \eqref{eq:focc2} and \eqref{eq:focn2}, we get:
$$\sqrt{c_{t}} = w_{t}$$

---
# Firm maximisation problem

The firm has a static maximisation problem:
$$\max_{\{n_{t}\}} A_{t}n_{t}^{\alpha}-w_{t}n_{t}$$

First Order Condition:
$$\alpha A_{t}n_{t}^{\alpha-1}-w_{t} = 0$$

---
# 6. Check

We have 7 unknown variables in our example: $c_{t}, n_{t}, a_{t}, p_{t}, d_{t}, w_{t}, y_{t}$.

For identification, we need 7 linearly independent equations.

$$
\begin{align}
    & \beta \mathbb{E}_{t} \left[\frac{d_{t+1} + p_{t+1}}{\sqrt{c_{t+1}}}\right] = \frac{p_{t}}{\sqrt{c_{t}}} \tag{CE1} \\
    & \sqrt{c_{t}} = w_{t} \tag{CE2} \\
    & \alpha A_{t}n_{t}^{\alpha-1}-w_{t} = 0 \tag{CE3} \\
    & c_{t}+p_{t} a_{t}=w_{t} n_{t}+\left(d_{t}+p_{t}\right) a_{t-1} \tag{CE4} \\
    & y_{t} = A_{t}n_{t}^{\alpha} \tag{CE5} \\
    & d_{t} = y_{t} - w_{t}n_{t} \tag{CE6} \\
    & a_{t} = 1 \tag{CE7} \\
    & \lim_{T \to \infty} \beta^{T} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\frac{d_{T} + p_{T}}{\sqrt{c_{T}}}a_{T} \right] = 0 \tag{TVC}
\end{align}
$$

These 7 equations plus the transversality condition characterise the competitive equilibrium for the economy.

???
We have 2 equations from the household's maximisation problem, 1 equation from the firm's maximisation problem, 3 resource constraints, 1 market clearing condition and finally a tranversality condition:

### Walras' Law
Note that while we had 2 market clearing conditions: $y_{t} = c_{t}$ and $a_{t} = 1$, we only need to include one market clearing condition, as the other one will hold in equilibrium by *Walras' law*. Equations (4), (6) and (7) will imply $y_{t} = c_{t}$.

# Practice
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Problem]
Consider the Brock-Mirman optimal growth model with stochastic shocks. The social planner chooses the paths for consumption and capital to maximise 
$$\mathbb{E}_{t}\left\{\sum_{\tau=t}^{\infty}\beta^{\tau-t} \ln{c_{\tau}} \right\}$$
subject to 
$$c_{t} + k_{t+1} \leq Ak_{t}^{\alpha}\theta_{t}$$ 
$k_{t}$ given, $A > 0, 0 < \alpha < 1$, where $\{\theta_{t}\}$ is an i.i.d. sequence with $\ln{\theta_{t}}$ distributed $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

- Derive the conditions of the equilibrium of this economy.
